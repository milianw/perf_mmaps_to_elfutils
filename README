This is a reproducer for issues with feeding libdwfl the perf mmap events, cf. https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/125

To use it, first run perf on an application of your choice:

    $ perf record --call-graph dwarf <...>

Now create a text file with all the mmap events in the perf data file:

    $ perf script -show-mmap-events | grep PERF_RECORD_MMAP2 > mmaps.txt

Then feed this file into the reproducer:

    $ ./perf_mmaps_to_elfutils mmaps.txt

You should notice some discrepandcies between actual mmap events and what libdwfl sees.
